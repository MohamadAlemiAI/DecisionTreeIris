Decision Tree Classifier
Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier using Python. Decision trees are powerful machine learning models that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In this project, we focus on classification.

Features
Decision Tree Algorithm: We’ve implemented the decision tree algorithm from scratch, allowing us to customize hyperparameters and gain a deeper understanding of how decision trees work.
Feature Importance: The trained decision tree provides insights into feature importance, helping us identify which features contribute most significantly to the classification.
Visualization: We visualize the decision tree using libraries such as matplotlib or graphviz, making it easier to interpret the model.


# Load your dataset (X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=5)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = clf.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}%")

# Visualize the decision tree
clf.plot_tree()
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Customization
Adjust hyperparameters such as max_depth, min_samples_split, and min_samples_leaf to optimize the model for your specific problem.
Experiment with different splitting criteria (e.g., Gini impurity or entropy) to see which works best for your dataset.
